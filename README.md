# React Boilerplate

This is a simple React project structure made from scratch.

## Goals

I wanted to create a very basic boilerplate for React applications with some support for SASS. This seemed to me to be a good way to study about the library and a quick way to start new personal projects. This is simpler than "create-react-app", but not as solid and not as easy.

## Instructions

1. Install the dependencies with `$ yarn install`
2. You can run your app in development mode with `$ yarn dev` or with `$ yarn build`for the production build.

## Dependencies

- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `@babel/core`
- `@babel/cli`
- `@babel/preset-env`
- `babel-loader`
- `webpack`
- `webpack-cli`
- `webpack-dev-server`
- `html-webpack-plugin`
- `cross-env`
- `style-loader`
- `css-loader`
- `sass-loader`
- `node-sass`
- `@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin`
- `react-refresh`
